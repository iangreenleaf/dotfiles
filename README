This repo uses rcm, an rc file manager.

To begin, install rcm and run `setup.sh`.

To update an installation, simply run `rcup`.

Note: Karabiner config for Macs hasn't been fully automated yet. Any changes made
through Karabiner will need to be manually copied back to `config/karabiner/karabiner.json`.
